        Bluprints (or recipes) for solving common sotware design problems.

        They are not perfect. There are trade-offs and you have to figure out how to apply certain design

    - Behavioral Pattern:
        Allow you to focus on how objets are connected and how they communicate -- simplifying control flow.

        It also have to do how we do something algorithmically and usually making a choice.

        It is concerned with how we create objects

        It is a way to abstract or make sager a way for us to create objects.
