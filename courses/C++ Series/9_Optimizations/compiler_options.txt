
1. Generate assembly

	> g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -S

	This will generate a file called main.s with the assimby data


See binary symbols
> nm 



2. Write effective modern C++

	Use -Weffc++ with g++ to write effective modern C++

	> g++ -std=c++17 -Weffc++ main.cpp -o prog




3. It only runs the preprocessor and outputs the preprocessed source to stdout.

	What -E does

		- Expands #include files
		- Expands macros
		- Removes comments
		- Does not compile or assemble
		- Prints the result to the terminal unless you redirect it


g++ -E main.cpp > main.i


4 - Signed / Unsigned comparison and implicit conversions

    Use -Wall flag to prevent this operatoins

    int a = -2;
    unsigned int b = 1;

    // a (int) is implicitly converted to unsigned int
    // -2 becomes 4294967294 (modulo 2^32 on a 32-bit unsigned int)
    if( a > b )
//      ~~^~~
// warning: comparison of integer expressions of different signedness: 'int' and 'unsigned int' [-Wsign-compare]     
        std::cout << "Sth is wrong here!\n"; // Sth is wrong here!
