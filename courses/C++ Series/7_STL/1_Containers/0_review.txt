		Sequence containers implement data structures which can be accessed sequentially.

	<array>
	<vector>
	<deque>
	<forward_list>
	<list>
	std::string is a 'pseudo container' if you perefer to think of 
	it as a specific instance of a sequence container

 

Associative containers
	Associative containers implement sorted data structures (Red-black-tree) that can be quickly 
searched (O(log n) complexity).

	<set>
		set
		map
	<map>
		multiset
		multimap

Unordered associative containers
	Unordered associative containers implement unsorted (hashed) data structures that can be 
quickly searched (O(1) average, O(n) worst-case complexity).

	<unordered_set>
		unordered_set
		unordered_multiset
	<unordered_map>
		unordered_map
		unordered_multimap
  

Container adaptors
	Container adaptors provide a different interface for sequential containers.

	<stack>
	<queue>
		queue
	 	priority_queue
