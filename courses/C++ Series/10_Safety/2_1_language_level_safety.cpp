Safety in C++ Programming:

What can of safety can I buy?

There are 3 general places where I can apply safety tools. The currency may be to pay some performance

    1. Language level
    1. Library level
    1. Tooling level

 NOTE: There are probably more than 3 places: network, cloud, database, hardware, etc.

C++ Language features for safety

    Features  build into the language standadt to assist us achieve our programming goals

        * Compile-time safety:
            const
            constexptr, constinit, consteval
            static_cast
            static_assert
            Fixed width types (e.g int16_t, int32_t, etc)
            Attributes (nothrow, nosidcard, fallthorugh)
            explicit constructor
        * Run-time safety
            assert
            Exceptions
            Variable initialization
            RAII
            dyanamic_cast vs reinterpret_cast or C-style cast
            thread_local
